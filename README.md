This app is created as part of the Mobile App Development Capstone Project course in Coursera.

The app helps users maintain a schedule of medicines they have to take and provide reminders at the scheduled times.
The user can maintain a history of various health parameters such as weight, blood sugar level, blood pressure, etc and can easily visualize the trends.
